# PaddyVisionAI
PaddyVision AI is an AI which utilises resnet 50 base model with imagenet weights to accurately predict nitrogen deficiency level of paddy plants with the help of the image of paddy leaf.
The dataset used for this purpose was obtained from Kaggle:
MyoMinHtet. (2022). <i>Nitrogen deficiency for rice crop</i> [Data set]. Kaggle. https://doi.org/10.34740/KAGGLE/DSV/4588959
and can be acessed by the following URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/myominhtet/nitrogen-deficiency-for-rice-crop
The main file is the code for initialising the ai model and training it as well as saving it as .h5 file
The evaluation file has the code for evaluation of the ai and calculates accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of the AI
To run the code ensure that the paths of dataset are revised
Also the path to the dataset needs to be revised accordingly
